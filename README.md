# Graph Magic - How To Turn Your Life Into Nightmare and Back
So, here we demonstrate the result of our hard work dedicated to research on graphs and
algorithms that help us find the least path through the graph itself.

At the very beginning we are given some pre-made code elements and ready algorithms.
Our task was to analyse them and come up with our own alternative ways to make
the similar thing and then compare their effectiveness.

We are dealing with both __ordered__ and __unordered__ graphs, which are __weighted__
(each edge has its own weight). We had to take into consideration the algorithms such
as: _Kruskal's_ algorithm, _Prim's_ algorithm, _Bellman-Ford_ algorithm and
_Floyd-Warshall_ algorithm.

Our hard work was divided into __3__ separate parts. They are:
1. Making own versions of Kruskal and Prim's algorithms and comparing them to
built-in algorithms
2. Making own versions of Bellman-Ford algorithm and
Floyd-Warshall algorithm and comparing them to
built-in algorithms
3. Working with decision trees via our own kitty paws.

Let's take a sneak peak at them.

## Task #1

## Task #2

## Task #3
